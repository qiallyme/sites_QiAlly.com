# Welcome to Qi Ally

Today we're officially launching **Qi Ally**—a new kind of consulting practice built for growth-stage companies that need C-suite leadership without full-time overhead.

## Why Qi Ally?

Over the past decade, I've worked with dozens of founders and leadership teams navigating the messy middle: post-product-market-fit, pre-IPO, somewhere between scrappy and scaled.

The pattern was clear: **companies hit walls not because they lacked vision, but because they lacked systems, clarity, and operational horsepower.**

- A brilliant CEO drowning in spreadsheets instead of leading strategy
- A COO who's actually just a project manager wearing too many hats
- A finance "system" held together by duct tape and a Google Sheet

Enter **fractional leadership.**

## What We Do

Qi Ally offers three core pillars:

1. **Fractional CFO** — Strategic finance, fundraising support, financial systems
2. **Fractional COO** — Operations design, process optimization, scalability planning
3. **AI Workflows** — Custom automation, LLM integrations, intelligent systems

We don't parachute in with cookie-cutter solutions. We listen, design with you, execute alongside you, and leave you stronger.

## Who We Serve

We work best with:

- **Pre-seed to Series B startups** needing their first finance or ops leader
- **Bootstrapped companies** scaling without VC timelines
- **Nonprofits & mission-driven orgs** navigating funding shifts or strategic pivots
- **Professional services firms** ready to leverage AI and automation

## What Makes Us Different

🔹 **Embedded, not advisory** — We integrate into your rhythm, not replace it  
🔹 **Knowledge transfer built-in** — You won't be dependent on us forever  
🔹 **AI-first operations** — We design systems that scale with intelligence, not just effort  
🔹 **No BS, no buzzwords** — Clear language, clear deliverables, clear outcomes  

## What's Next?

If you're navigating growth, chaos, or a pivot—and you need a trusted operator who can bridge strategy and execution—[let's talk](/contact).

We're here to help you find your rhythm.
